# Turtle-Race-Using-Random-Variables
Made a python-based program extensively using turtle module that assigns random variables to 5 different objects, i.e., turtles. Thereafter, a sequence of these random variables is created in this random experiment project. Once this sequence ends, the turtle that reaches the finish line first wins the race.
